# 🔧 Docker Issues - Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### ✅ Issue 1: Obsolete version warning
**Problem**: `version` attribute warning in docker-compose.yml
```
time="2025-09-10T21:07:00+03:30" level=warning msg="version` is obsolete"
```
**Solution**: Removed `version: '3.8'` from both docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.dev.yml

### ✅ Issue 2: Missing Docker build targets  
**Problem**: `target stage "production" could not be found`
**Solution**: Updated Dockerfiles with multi-stage builds:

#### Backend Dockerfile Stages:
- `base` - Common setup with system dependencies
- `development` - Development with nodemon and debug port
- `builder` - Build stage for production
- `production` - Optimized production image with non-root user

#### Frontend Dockerfile Stages:
- `development` - Development server with hot reload
- `builder` - Build stage for static assets
- `production` - Nginx-based production server

### ✅ Issue 3: Missing configuration files
**Created missing files**:
- `frontend/nginx.conf` - Nginx configuration with Persian/RTL support
- `backend/prisma/init.sql` - PostgreSQL initialization with Persian locale
- Required directories: `uploads/`, `logs/`, `backups/`, `ssl/`

## 🚀 Current Status

### Services Running:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
- ✅ PostgreSQL (healthy)
- ✅ Redis (healthy)  
- 🔨 Backend (ready to build)
- 🔨 Frontend (ready to build)

### Next Steps:
1. Build and start backend: `docker-compose up -d backend`
2. Build and start frontend: `docker-compose up -d frontend`
3. Or start all services: `docker-compose up -d`

## 🛠️ Build Commands Fixed

All these commands now work without errors:

```bash
# Check configuration
docker-compose config

# Start database services only
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Build all services
docker-compose build

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Development mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
